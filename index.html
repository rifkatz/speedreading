        <h4>What is speed reading?</h4>
        <p>
               Reading has been a very important skill for centuries. Most of our history, which we know comes from writing and therefore without the ability to read we would barely know anything about our ancestors. However reading, especially reading in short period of time, has not been such an important ability before, as it is in information era. The reason behind that is the fact that with new sources of information (such as internet) and constant discoveries and news, the worldâ€™s history has never been recorded as detailed as it is now. And with speed of 300 symbols per minute it would take over a year to read all articles published in one day. </p>


    <p>That is why the term speed reading has been used more and more often in everyday life. You probably heard this term already but did you ever question yourself what speed reading actually is?</p>


    <p>The answer to this question is simple and straightforward: speed reading is a technique which allows one to read with great speed. It is collection of exercises aimed to tackle different problems connected with the traditional reading. These exercises have been developed very recently but already more than 100 million people around the world use these techniques to help them manage with their jobs, homework assignments and tests.</p>

    <p>The speed reading allows one to increase his or her reading speed from 300 symbols per minute up to 5000 symbols from only 4 weeks, which this course lasts. And if it is practiced regularly speed of 10 000 and even 15 000 symbols per minute can be achieved, which is 50 times as quick as average reading speed. You may say to yourself that achieving this speed is a very difficult process requiring super mind, but in fact anyone can do this and it is easily achieved with this course of speed reading.</p>
    
    <h4>How to use this website:</h4>
    <p>The course is recommended to be completed over 4 weeks period of time and so one should study 2 lessons per week, for example every tuesday and thursday. It can of course be completed in shorter or longer period of time but the benefits of the course will be significantly less.</p>
    
<p>    In order to navigate between the lessons use the book and select your lesson. Read the lesson through and follow the instructions. At the end of each lesson homework but additionally you must read 2 articles of your choice until the next lesson, using the newly learned techniques.</p>
