        <h2>Lesson 4 - Articulation</h2>
        <p>
        Aim of the lesson - to learn the method of rhythmic tapping in order to reduce articulation during the process of reading.
        </p>
        <h4>What is articulation?</h4>
        <p>Articulation can be defined as the natural instinct to say out loud the text, which is being read. The are three levels of articulation. 
</p>
		<p>The most extreme level is when the person reads the text, which he or she is reading out loud. This is the slowest process and is forbidden in speed reading because saying something out loud takes much more time than to read it silently
</p>
		<p>The inner voice is the level at which the reader pronounces the words he or she is reading in his or her head, so not saying anything out loud. This process is allowed in speed reading but is not recommended.
</p>
		<p>The least level of articulation is called silent reading. It is different to inner voice because the reader does not pronounce the text he or she is reading even in his or her head. This level is achieved by most speed readers and is the most efficient.
</p>
		<p>For most of the readers the level of articulation is either extreme or at point of inner voice and this creates a problem as it slows down the reading speed. Therefore this is also tackled in this course.
</p>
		<h4>How can you remove articulation?</h4>
		<p>Because of the fact that articulation has a big impact on the reading speed we propose technique called “rhythmic tapping” (RT). The concept of RT is the following, when reading you tap a special rhythm, using your whole arm. There are 4 half notes and 4 long notes in the rhythm, which do not correspond with regular reading melody and therefore does not allow you to say text out loud. The rhythm is the following:
</p>
  <div>
            <a href="#" ><img src="images/notes.png" /></a>
        </div>
		<p>In order to remove articulation one must tap for at least 20 hours and therefore from now on when you read you should take a pen or a pencil as if you are holding a baseball bat and tap using your whole arm to make up and down movement. You should do it with one hand for 2 hours and then use two hands for the other 18 hours.
</p>
		<p>There are 3 phases which you are going to go through when using RT:
</p>
		<p>1. Reading with RT without understanding
</p>
		<p>2. Reading with RT and understanding but without remembering
</p>
		<p>3. Reading with RT, understanding and remembering the text</p>
		<p>So it is only natural that you will start with phase 1 and do not give up because as you practice you will soon achieve phase 2 and then 3.
</p>
		<p>Homework for next lesson is to read 2 articles with use of the RT and tap the rhythm for at least 4 hours (1 h each day).
