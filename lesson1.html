        <h2>Lesson 1 - Regression</h2>
        <p>
        	Aim of the lesson - to identify quality and quantity of your reading skill as well as to learn the first technique of speed reading.</p>

	<p>From the very moment when you learned how to read, reading is a skill which followed and will follow your whole life. You are not satisfied with the your method of reading and it is no surprise you are. But before any skill can be improved, it is the key to find out what are the problems related with your reading technique. </p>
      
      <h4>What are disadvantages of traditional reading?</h4>
    	<p>At this point we will measure your reading speed. Please take find a timer and do not start reading the next paragraph until you are ready to start timing. Do not stop your timer until you see STOP in the text. Get ready, set, go.</p>
     
      <p>
      		There are 5 most significant problems of the classical reading can be underlined.
      </p>

      <p>
      		1) Regression. Regression is the process during reading, when reader's eyes come back to the part of the text and as a result reader reads the same text twice or even three times. This is the biggest and most common problem with traditional reading. Some readers unconsciously read the same text twice, regardless of its difficulty just to be sure. This creates a problem as an average reader regresses 10-15 times in a text, which has length of 100 words. Its obvious that this gradually decreases reading speed.

      </p>

      <p>
      		2) Lack of flexible technique of reading. What is meant behind this statement?

      </p>

      <p>
      			One of the biggest advantages of speed reading is not the increased speed but are the different approaches to text of different types. Most of people do not recognize different types of texts and therefore read all of them with same, slow speed. It is proven that most of the people have the same speed at reading a summary of bank account spendings as they read a play by Shakespeare. There is a clear those two texts are completely different and in fact one should just have a quick glance on the summary of spendings, looking at numbers, while take his or her time reading and understanding the meaning behind Shakespeare's masterpiece.

      </p>

      <p>
      		Aim of this course is to teach you different approaches to texts and a more effective program of interpreting texts. The solution to this problem will be taught in Lesson 2.

      </p>

      <p>
      		3) Articulation. Articulation is the process when the reader says what he is reading to himself. Different levels of articulation have different signs. At very high levels person mimes what he is reading to himself, while at low levels he can hear himself reading the words with his inner voice (so actually not pronouncing anything). This slows down the speed at which one can read and therefore this will be tackled in Lesson 4.

      </p>

      <p>
      		4) Low vision range. Vision range is the part of the text that is clearly visible with one fixation of your eyesight. With traditional reading technique, maximum vision range is 2-3 words. Therefore eye makes a lot of movements to read one line. Each movement requires the eye to focus, find and understand the text. This takes time and therefore with increased vision range number of those movements decreases and speed increases. During the course the vision range will increase from 2 - 3 words, up to whole line and even whole paragraph. This will be covered during the lessons 5 and 6.

      </p>

      <p>
      		5) Lack of attention. What is attention? Attention is the chosen focus of the brain on specific task. Speed reading requires really high level of attention. Unfortunately we are not always organized and not all of us are able to control their attention during reading.

      </p>

      <p>
      		Reading speed of many people is much lower than they would have without constantly being distracted by other ideas. During reading, many people listen to music, have their social media open and even watch tv. Therefore reading happens mechanically and the person does not understand most of the things they read. Because of the importance of attention during reading, a collection of exercises will be proposed to you during the 7th lesson.

      </p>
		<h5>STOP!</h5>
		<p>Write your time on a piece of paper and read the text paragraph to find out how to calculate your reading speed</p>      
        
        <h4>Calculating your reading speed and what does that speed mean?</h4> 
         <p>You can calculate your reading speed with the formula V= Q:T, where V is the reading speed (symbols per minute), Q is number of symbols in the text, T is the time taken for you to read that part of the text (min).</p>
         <p>So lets find out your reading speed, there are 2674 symbols in the text you just read. Lets imagine that it took you 7 minutes to read the text. So we divide 2674 by 7 and we get 382 symbols per second. This is an average reading speed for people who read using traditional reading technique. Below you can see the reading speed and what level does this correspond to, use this to find out your reading speed throughout the course. </p>
         <p>900 - 1200 s/min - Very slow. 1200-1500 s/min - Slow. 1500-1800 s/min - Medium. 1800-3000 s/min - Above medium. 3000-5000 s/min - Fast. 10 000-20 000 s/min - Very fast. 20 000 and above s/min - Extremly fast.</p>         
         <h4>Speed reading rule number 1 - Reading without regression</h4>
         <p>The rule states the following: I will read text of any difficulty only once, I will not move my eyes back to reread a word, a sentence, a paragraph I just read. I will read the text again only after I am done reading the whole text and only after I fully think through what I read and I will read again only if if is necessary.</p>
         <p>From now on, you should always follow this rule and never forget it, when reading.</p>
         <h4>Green dot exercise</h4>
         <p>Previously it has been mentioned that the vision range is highly important to the speed reading and therefore it must be increased from the very beginning. In order to do you can use the Green Dot Exercise. All you do is print out a part of any text on A5 paper and make a green circle in the center of the page about 1 mm in diameter. Then every day before going to sleep, look at the green dot at try to understand the words around the dot, then words in the line with the dot and finally try to understand all the words on the page, but do not move your eyes from green dot at any point of the exercise. Do this every evening before going to sleep for about 20 min.</p>
