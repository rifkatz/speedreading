        <h2>Lesson 3 - Dominant Algorithm of Reading (DAR)</h2>
        <p>
        Aim of the lesson - to teach brain to find the dominant idea in any kind of text
        </p>
        
        <p>For many centuries people tried to understand how our brain works. It is no surprise because it is such a complex machine, which can do things that robots and programs canâ€™t, to analyze things. This also includes texts during reading. Many authors hide their ideas with use of different literary devices, such as metaphors and similes, which makes it difficult for an average reader to understand the text. Therefore it is important to have an effective way to help yourself find the main idea of the text.</p>
        <p>The main idea of the text is also called the dominant idea. The reason behind that name is the fact that the idea is the most important part of the text. In order to create the dominant idea one can use DAR. DAR is also a very simple algorithm, just like IAR, and it works the following way:
</p>
        <p>1) In the text you highlight the key words
</p>
        <p>2) Out of the highlighted words you create small sentences (length of all senses combined, should be half of the number of key words)
</p>
        <p>3) You combine the small sentences to create one, about a quarter of the length of all the small sentences.
</p>
        <p>In order for you to remember how it works try to visualize this algorithm as the picture below.</p>
         <div>
            <a href="#" ><img src="images/dominant.png" /></a>
        </div>
        <p>It is necessary to find the dominant idea not only because it is the message of the text but also because more than 75% of text is just something called "water", which means that it is there but has no meaning, these are words such as "the, a, is". Remembering all of those words would be inefficient as they are not essential.</p>
        <p>Homework for next lesson is to read 2 articles and find the dominant ideas in each of them with use of DAR.
