        <h2>Lesson 2 - Integrated Algorithm of Reading</h2>
        <p>
       Aim of the lesson - to learn an effective and organized way of reading text in order to quickly get the most important information from the text.

        </p>
        
        <p>Most readers throughout the world do not have an organized way of remembering the texts they read. Most of people remember interesting but least important information about the text, for example in a newspaper article about the evolution most of the readers will remember that people are twice as big as human-like apes. And only a few readers will remember the main arguments against and for the theory of evolution. This does create a problem because in speed reading remembering the most important information is the key and therefore it is highly necessary to learn a more efficient technique to remember information. </p>
        <p>The technique is called integrated algorithm of reading (IAR). The reason why it is called integrated is the fact that it helps with remembering important parts of all the text, instead of specific parts of it.
</p>
        <p>In order to use IAR the reader must answer and remember the following questions during reading: </p>
        <p>1. Name of the text</p>
        <p>2. Author</p>
        <p>3. The source</p>
        <p>4. The problem, the argument being expressed in the text, main idea</p>
        <p>5. Facts</p>
        <p>6. Special facts, criticism, arguments for and against the main idea</p>
        <p>7. New facts for you and possibility for you to use them in practice</p>
        <p>IAR is quite simple but very effective techniques the reason. It is very effective because it helps you to remember the parts of the text, which are more likely to be asked, the name of the text, the author, the problem, etc. You might say it is not very easy to remember all the parts of IAR. To help you remember IAR try to picture it the same way as the picture below. </p>
        <div>
            <a href="#" ><img src="images/person.png" /></a>
        </div>
        <p>Now that you know what IAR is, your homework until the next lesson is to use the IAR on at least 2 articles and try to fill in all of the parts of IAR.</p>
